# IoT-SmartWaste
Done by: Group 12

This IoT Smart Waste Management System uses ultrasonic and smoke sensors (integrated with LoRaWAN and WiFi protocols) to monitor trash bin fill and CO2 levels in real time, optimizing waste collection routes and reducing operational costs. The low-power, long-range wireless network enables scalable deployment, while the cloud dashboard (ThingsBoard) provides analytics and insights.
